# DevJob-Tracker-Backend

## Purpose
I’m a soon to be graduate with a BSc. In Software Development, and I’m on the hunt for my first developer job. How could I increase my chances of landing one you may ask? Apply, apply, apply! There is only one drawback here, which is, how can I track every job I applied to? I could use an excel sheet, but c’mon…I’m a software developer and I can just build my solution. This is exactly the purpose of DevJob Tracker! This application is built to allow me to track all the jobs I applied to and keep updated on the status of those jobs.

## Requirements

This application is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). The features for this application are:
* Add and Delete job application entries.
* Declare the status for job applications such as: Waiting on Response, Interview, Rejection, and Offer. These need to be able to be updated.
* Have a visually appealing user interface dashboard.
* Provide stats for: Total number of jobs that I have applied for, number of responses, number of interviews, number of rejections and number of offers. These should be provided in fractional and percentage forms.
